## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Edited the description field of DESCRIPTION file to include references with doi
* Added data to package in order to add more examples in Rd-files for exported functions
* Some examples take >5 seconds to run so changed dontrun{} to donttest{}
* kfa_report example still uses dontrun{} because it produces html_document
